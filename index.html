                    due to an epidemic but was denied a Christian burial. This
                    was due to the fact that he was the brother-in-law of Jose

          <h3>Noli Me Tangere</h3>
          <img src="assets/noli.jpg" class="f-img" />
          <p class="f-descrip">
            The novel introduces Crisostomo Ibarra, a young and idealistic
            Filipino who returns to his homeland after completing his education
            in Europe after seven years. Going back to his home country, his
            eyes unfolded at the harsh realities his fellow countrymen
            experience under the Spanish rule.
          </p>

          <p>
            The novel further explores the power struggle between the rich and
            the poor, the exploitation of the lower class and pervasive abuse of
            power. Appalled by such atrocities, Ibarra devised a plan to take
            revenge on the Spanish friars. The ending of the novel? Well, it‚Äôs
            up to you to find out.
          </p>

        <div class="f-works">
          <h3>El Filibusterismo</h3>
          <img src="assets/elfili.jpg" class="f-img" />
          <p class="f-descrip">
            The sequel to Rizal‚Äôs Noli me T√°ngere, 13 years after that prison
            escape, we now follow Ibarra disguised as Simoun, a wealthy jeweller
            here in El Filibusterismo (translated as The Reign of the Greed). In
            the second novel, Simoun tries to operate within the system,
            blending within the higher ups and forming ties with the enemies
            while gathering strength with his newfound allies.
          </p>
          <p>
            His plan was clear and carefully devised, but an unexpected turn of
            events made an impact into the trajectory of his plan. Just like its
            prequel, El Filibusterismo is one of the celebrated written works of
            Jose Rizal, playing a significant role in igniting the flames of
            nationalism among the Filipinos. Trivia: Jose Rizal dedicated El
            Filibusterismo to the GOMBURZA, the three martyr Filipino priests
            who were accused of subversion and were executed in the garrote.
